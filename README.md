# P1: Movie Trailer Website
**Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree**

This project containers a server-side script that stores a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery, movie trailer, and various movie information supplied by the OMDb API (www.omdbapi.com). The list is then generated into a static HTML file that loads within your browser.

## Quick Start - Running Locally
* Install the most recent Python 2 version, which is currently [Python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
* Clone this repo: `https://github.com/jeusier/full-stack-udacity-p1.git`
* Open the IDLE program that was installed by Python
* In IDLE, open the `entertainment_center.py` script found in the cloned repo
* In the IDLE window for `entertainment_center.py`, click on Run > Run Module to run the `entertainment_center.py` script
* The page should run automatically after running the script, or you can manually open `fresh_tomatoes.html`
