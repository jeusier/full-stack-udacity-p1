# P1: Movie Trailer Website
**Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree**

This project containers a server-side script that stores a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery, movie trailer, and various movie information supplied by the OMDb API (www.omdbapi.com). The list is then generated into a static HTML file that loads within your browser.

## Quick Start - Running Locally
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* Clone this repo: `https://github.com/jeusier/full-stack-udacity-p1.git`
* Run the `fresh_tomatoes.py` script
* The page should run automatically after running the script, or you can manually open `fresh_tomatoes.html`
